This project is aimed at using computer vision to develop an application that can be used to convert images into html pages styled with css

How do I go about this:
- Upload an image, perspective transform to get the paper
- Shape and dimensions approximation to get the type of html element
- create final html file

Limitations:
- type of paper (ideally a plain paper)
- contrast issues

Task 1:
- isolate paper from background (using edge detection and thresholding)
- Maybe contrast improvement
- documentation

Task 2:
- shape detection for inputs, cards, radio buttons et al
- shape detection with rounded corners (border radius)
- text detection for labels or text inside elements
- documentation

Task 3:
- Generating html and css code based on results from shape detection task
- documentation

Task 4:
- providing an interface for users to test it out
- documentation
